My version of pacman written on assembler, there is a few things that should be mantioned:

1. Game is infinite, apples will randomly spawn on the map

2. Random is a bit broken, chanse of spawning apples in the bottom of a map is higher than on top (My bad)

3. Bots are REALLY difficult, maybe i can proud of them, but they alway try to cut way to you, what makes game really hard

---

Of course there are a lot of features that can be added, i just tryed myself in a really interesting task, feel free to test ~~or copy+paste~~
