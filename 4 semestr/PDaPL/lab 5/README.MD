ST - simple test
HT - hard test (files >64kb, critical to work for van)

---

i wrote a veeeeery greedy algorithm, so if you run HT2 you'll need like 8 minutes to wait while it all passed, but it is working and i'm fine with it.

But for my luck i get not very hard task, but still, not the easiest. It took me 12 hours to write this lab (press F)
