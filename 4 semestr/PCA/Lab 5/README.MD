Not fairly done Lab 5

---

Standart mistakes, Odinec (teacher) doesnot like when students use 4h interruption to check if interruption actually was implemented,

In my case, i've done set\output time+date myself, but look how other people reimplement alarm interruption (what was my big mistake). In Alarms functions were implemented normal interuption checker (but there is problem, that it was ridden, but not checked, funny yeah) and interruption that Odinec hates.

So i dont recommend to use my version of lab and if you find simillar code, just understand that people also decided to copy+paste some functions, be smart.

Also this lab is not working in dosbox, only vritual dos, so dont forget to use my [script](https://github.com/raik199x/BSUIR-labs/blob/main/4%20semestr/PCA/Lab%201%20(tty0tty)/DosMakesGoBrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.sh) (if you wish)
