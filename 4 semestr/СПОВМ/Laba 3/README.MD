Some words about additional task:

Current program is set up to work with two terminals, to work normally you have to change litterally one line of code

Normally, in parrent procces we write name of file and send it to child proces,
parent start counting 5 sec while child proccess open file and count number of symbols in this file

readme.txt - random file that we can use to count symbols
