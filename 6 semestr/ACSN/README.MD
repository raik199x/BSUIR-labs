## Native or Wine?

Glezevich recommends to use his versions of PacketTracer and GNS, but it's not forbidden to use latest\nightly versions, so

### Cisco Packet Tracer

Is not available (2023) in Belarus, so it is hard to use native version on Linux, BUT it is possible, however i used nordvpn which one was detected by cisco, so i used wine version of it.

### GNS

Works perfectly, but installation might be tricky, strongly recommend to use qemu for virtual machines in GNS.

## My variant is 930
