## Condition

You need to multiply two 3-dimension matrix

Show complete time using automatic vectorization, self-made vectorization and turned off vectorization

## What is the main problem?

As a condition for lab, you need to prove that automatic vectorization it turned on\off and make self made vectorization work equal
or faster that automatic.

Is for some reason automatic vectorization completed with equal time as turned off vectorization, you need to prove
that vectorization was actually disabled\enabled

## Questions

1. Which vectorization are exist? (SSE, AVX...)
