# Lab 5-6

@ Dmitriy Pertsev

## Important note

2023 - this is an experimental task, so we dunno if condition changes, also this lab counts as two (5, 6) even though lab 5 is about gray scale image and lab 6 is about 3-channel image. The teachers said that those methods that are used in lab are equal for gray scale and 3-channel images, but in reality i can't guarantee that, even more, if you put true gray scale image, i'm pretty sure that program just crashes

## Condition

check pdf

## Useful links

[Cuda official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#device-memory)

3.2.2 Device memory

But to be honest, there is REAL lack of information about pitched memory

## Important note

one memory changed to pinned, since it was condition for 7 lab, if needed, you can change back
