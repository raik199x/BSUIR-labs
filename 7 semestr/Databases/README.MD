# Databases

## Remarks

Theme: Cinema

Teacher: Anna Olegovna

This database (or it's entries) devoted to a person, who became a legend during her lifetime, a people's teacher of BSUIR, a well-recognized, famous, authoritative person, who created this era and ultimately became this era herself - Anna Olegovna.

## Caution

Some of queries are questionable or just stupid, but do not blame me for creating them, my imagination just died since we need to create ~30 requests.
